  <h3>Background:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left"><a href="https://seeclickfix.com">SeeClickFix</a> is an application that allows
    citizens to report non emergency issues to their local governments,
    such as potholes, sidewalk damage, etc. All such reports have geographic
    information and are freely available on the <a href="https://dev.seeclickfix.com">api</a></p>
  <p style="text-align:left">Currently, there is no way for citizen or government users to quickly search for
    areas in their cities where particular issues keep recurring,
    or a large number of issues are ignored. This project aims to provide such a resource
    by locating clusters of issues that are close together and sorting those clusters by the
    total number of issues in each cluster and the ratio of unresolved issues in each cluster.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left">The application allows the user to browse through each of the clusters,
    visualizing the each cluster on a map. The application also allows the
    user to click on the individual issue to get a description.</p>
  <h3>What I did:</h3>
  <ul style="text-align:left">
    <li><p>Implemented K-means Clustering to locate clusters of issues.</p></li>
    <li><p>Retreived data from SeeClickFix API and placed in firebase after processing.</p></li>
    <li><p>Implemented web application that retrieves data from firebase and displays clusters in order of ranking.</p></li>
  </ul>
